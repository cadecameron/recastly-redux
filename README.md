# recastly-redux
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## High Level Goals of this Sprint
- Learn React and how to think about web apps as components in React
- Learn Redux and how to implement state management
- Learn how to transpile code with Babel's command line tool
- Practice using ES6 features
- Continue practicing interactions with a REST API (in this case, the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/?hl=en))
